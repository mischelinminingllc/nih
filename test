ABSTRACT
The qualitative research interview is an important data collection tool for a variety of methods used within the broad spec-
trum of medical education research. However, many medical teachers and life science researchers undergo a steep learning
curve when they first encounter qualitative interviews, both in terms of new theory but also regarding new methods of
inquiry and data collection. This article introduces the concept of qualitative research interviews for novice researchers
within medical education, providing 12 tips for conducting qualitative research interviews.
Introduction
In medical education research, the qualitative research
interview is a viable and highly utilized data-collection tool
(DiCicco-Bloom and Crabtree 2006; Jamshed 2014). There
are a range of interview formats, conducted with both indi-
viduals and groups, where semi-structured interviews are
becoming increasingly prevalent in medical education
research. Qualitative interviews afford researchers opportu-
nities to explore, in an in-depth manner, matters that are
unique to the experiences of the interviewees, allowing
insights into how different phenomena of interest are
experienced and perceived. Considering the relationship
between participants and researchers and the emphasis on
the exploration of human phenomena, interviews have
traditionally been a data-collection method linked with
qualitative research and the naturalistic paradigm (C^ote
and Turgeon 2005; Halcomb and Davidson 2006).
In medical education, many researchers have a back-
ground in health care professional backgrounds, and
although subjects, such as interview techniques and his-
tory-taking are included in medical, nursing, and other
health professional curricula, the acquisition of interview
skills for the purpose of collecting research data is not gen-
erally addressed in the broad spectrum of health care pro-
fessional education. Consequently, making the transition
from working as a health care professional to conducting
medical education research involving qualitative research
interviews presents a number of challenges (Hodges and
Kuper 2012; Varpio et al. 2015). Not only does the new dis-
cipline present challenges in the form of engaging with
new types of theoretical knowledge, often presented as
learning theories, but novices to medical education
research will undoubtedly encounter a range of new meth-
ods of inquiry and data collection, including the qualitative
research interview (Laksov et al. 2017). Furthermore, there
are few guidelines relating to the practice of conducting
qualitative research interviews. Brinkmann and Kvale (2005)
argue that one of the challenges of conducting interviews
is that they are carried out under the naïve assumption
that the researcher wants to achieve understanding
through dialog and discussion. Interviews should not be
conceived as informal chats with interviewees; instead they
are data-collection instruments which can be used to pene-
trate a number of research questions. Consequently, given
the emerging position of interviews in medical education
research, we identify the need to articulate 12 tips for con-
ducting qualitative research interviews.
The tips presented below borrow insights from our own
experiences as qualitative researchers as well as from the
extensive literature on qualitative research methods. The
tips may be more useful in different phases of the inter-
view, some tips may be relevant during the planning
phase, others while conducting interviews, while others still
are most relevant after the interview.
Tip 1
Identify when qualitative research interviews are
appropriate
Qualitative interviewing is a data-collection tool that is use-
ful in a range of methodological approaches and may there-
fore be applied to address a number of research questions.
However, qualitative research interviews are preferable when
the researcher strives to understand the interviewee’s sub-
jective perspective of a phenomenon rather than generating
generalizable understandings of large groups of people, for
example, the qualitative interview may lend itself well to
exploring a patient’s experience of illness, or a clinician’s
conceptions of learning in the workplace. As such, a study
applying qualitative interviews holds the potential to give
voice to minorities and groups in society that may not be
heard elsewhere (Reeves et al. 2015). Moreover, one should
consider the ethical dimensions of taking up time from

interviewees and therefore only include as many participants
as needed in the research project and who may have
insights or experiences of the phenomenon in question.
Tip 2
Prepare yourself as an interviewer
The importance of accurate preparation on behalf of the
interviewer should not be underestimated and includes
conceptual and practical preparations (Brinkmann and
Kvale 2005; Brinkmann 2014). Successful interviews start
with careful planning that considers the focus and scope of
the research question. Some background reading of the lit-
erature concerning the subject area as well as how to con-
duct qualitative interviews and the specific scientific
method you are applying will be necessary in the further
development of your research question(s) and it will add-
itionally facilitate the construction of an interview guide.
When preparing for qualitative interviewing it is import-
ant to be familiar with the data recording equipment being
used. The venue of the interview should also be considered
as it may affect the data collection. We recommend inter-
views be conducted at a time and place of the respondents’
convenience, in a comfortable setting, free from any poten-
tial disruptions and noise. In most cases, you will need for-
mal ethical approval. However, you will always need your
interviewees’ informed consent (Illing 2014).
Tip 3
Construct an interview guide and test your questions
Conducting a qualitative research interview means that you
may be asking your interviewees to reflect on matters that
are potentially important to them, in some cases even life-
changing. The phenomenon of your interest might be
important professionally, or you may be interviewing partici-
pants on how they experience illness or the loss of a loved
one. Therefore, you should develop your interview guide in
advance and conduct at least one test interview. By con-
ducting test interviews the novice researcher gains skills
prior to embarking on data collection. These test interviews
may be undertaken with peers or volunteers. They furnish
the researcher with an opportunity to explore language, the
clarity of the questions, and aspects of active listening. The
style of the interview is essential for creating a noninvasive
and open dialog with interviewees (Krag Jacobsen 1993).
Avoid using esoteric jargon in your research interview ques-
tions and instead adopt layman’s language when possible.
Qualitative interviews may be more or less open or struc-
tured. An unstructured or semi-structured interview guide
may include only one or a few predetermined questions
allowing the interviewer to explore issues brought forward
by the interviewee. It is important that the interview guide
aligns with the methodological approach (Laksov et al.
2017). By contrast, a structured interview guide usually
includes predetermined questions posed in the same way to
all interviewees with the purpose of eliciting responses to
the exact same phrasing. In medical education, semi-
structured interviews are often applied, meaning that the
interview guide includes a number of predetermined ques-
tions (typically 5–15 questions) but the interviewer can
probe, in order to dig deeper, into the interviewees’
responses through follow-up questions (Lingard and
Kennedy 2010). It is usually a good idea to open the inter-
view with a few “easy” questions to make the interviewee
comfortable and to familiarize him/her with the subject of
the interview. A few examples are: “Please tell me, how long
have you been working here?”, “How did you first become
involved in teaching?” or “Why did you want to become a
nurse?” Further into the interview, questions like “In your
opinion, what signifies a skilled teacher?” or “How have you
experienced the work load in your current workplace?” are
more likely to be answered considerately as opposed to if
they were posed as the first question of the interview.
A question like “Is there anything more you would like to
add?” can be a suitable closing question.
Tip 4
Consider cultural and power dimensions of the
interview situation
An assessment of the cultural dimensions as well as power
dimensions is necessary prior to the interview (Nimmon and
Stenfors-Hayes 2016). Such an analysis could entail a consid-
eration of what the interview situation affords and what
obstacles are likely to occur. People are cultural beings
(Rogoff 2003) and may have different expectations of the
interview situation. Some people may view the interview as
a difficult or invasive situation, and some interviews may
require a third person to sit in, either as an interpreter or as
someone who is culturally sensitive to the interviewees’ situ-
ation. The test interview outlined above may reveal such
challenges. Medical teachers interviewing students need to
be aware of both explicit and implicit power relationships
and be conscious that students are not trying to comply
with expectations of providing, what is perceived to be, a
correct response. Similarly, a student interviewing teachers
may involve and mirror a power relationship and would
require careful consideration in advance.
Tip 5
Build rapport with your respondents
Building rapport and establishing comfortable interactions
in the qualitative interview situation is very important and
is preferably done well in advance of the interview, but
also during the interview itself. A challenge when conduct-
ing interviews is that there may be little time in the inter-
view situation to build trust (DiCicco-Bloom and Crabtree
2006). Therefore, you should draft a short summary of your
research project, written in layman’s terms, to send to your
interviewees prior to the interview as a way of informing
them of what to expect will be talked about in the inter-
view and why it is an important topic to discuss.
Rapport is also crucial during the interview enabling the
respondent to provide a rich and detailed account of the
experiences at the heart of the study. Key to building rap-
port is a sense of proximity. If you already know your
respondents, then it may be easier to build rapport; other-
wise, this task may be more difficult. One way of building
rapport is to approach interviewees with an open and curi-
ous attitude, stating specifically why you are interested in
MEDICAL TEACHER 1003
their specific point of view (Krag Jacobsen 1993; Schoultz
et al. 2001; Bell 2014). A question like “Please tell me about
your interest in … ?” is likely to be understood as less
threatening than “What rules and regulations do you follow
when … ”
Tip 6
Remember you are a co-creator of the data
In qualitative research, the researcher is the prime instru-
ment of data collection. Consequently, the interviewer
needs to be reflexive, conscious, and aware about how his
or her role might impact the conversation between the
interviewer and interviewee. In the qualitative research
interview, we argue that the interviewer should not be
viewed as someone contaminating or biasing the data, but
rather as a co-creator of data together with the inter-
viewee, where the interviewer’s previous knowledge may
play an important part in understanding of the context or
the experiences of the interviewee. As such, the interviewer
is not a passive player in the interview, but an instrument
using his and her abilities, experiences and competencies
in the interview situation (Lingard and Kennedy 2010). For
example, an interviewer who is also a clinician may use his
or her knowledge about the clinical environment and invite
the interviewee to discuss clinical issues more in-depth
than if the interviewer was unfamiliar to the clinical con-
text. Therefore, we urge interviewers to make use of their
background, albeit, in a considerate way.
Tip 7
Talk less and listen more
Inexperience as novice interviewers may result in the inter-
viewer being overly active in the conversations. Due to ner-
vousness in such situations, or a lack of experience, the
interviewee may end up filling in blanks and driving the
conversation in a certain direction without being aware of
doing so. Interviewers may need to talk less and allow for
silence to act as the catalyst that will drive the conversa-
tion forward. Actively listening to the interviewees means
respecting silence and identifying such silent moments as
an opportunity for ongoing reflection. Interviews on sub-
jects that have profound meaning for interview subjects
may prompt deep reflection on behalf of respondents.
Thus, remain open and honest, maintain interest (Bowden
and Walsh 2000; Seidman 2013), listen more, but also listen
actively (Giger 2017).
Tip 8
Allow yourself to adjust the interview guide
Adjusting the questions after the initial interviews allows
the interview guide to be fine-tuned during the interview
process. Some questions might turn out to be misunder-
stood, others to be irrelevant or outside the scope of the
research question. In one of our own studies, for example,
the question “How do you experience the atmosphere
here?” was understood by students as a question about
the physical environment and the quality of the air,
while the intention of the interviewer was to gain insight
into the social environment in the clinic (Liljedahl et al.
2015). So be attentive, listen to how your interviewees
respond, and reflect on whether your questions are being
understood in the way you intended. During an interview,
follow-up questions can help probe how your questions are
understood. Also, be courageous and make changes in the
interview guide before the next interview when necessary.
Tip 9
Be prepared to handle unanticipated emotions
In the field of medical education, we sometimes engage
with research topics involving illness and death or inter-
viewees’ own experiences of e.g. harassment, stress, failure,
or interviewee’s experiences of students with mental illness.
These and many other topics may evoke uneasy emotions
in the interviewee, which he or she previously might have
been unaware of. Therefore, the interviewer must be sensi-
tive to the interviewee’s reactions when sharing experien-
ces on certain topics. Sometimes interviewees will be
capable of handling these emotions themselves, but at
other times you, as an interviewer, will need to take action
to protect your interviewee (Varpio and McCarthy 2018).
This might involve interrupting the interview and guiding
the interviewee to appropriate assistance. Invite the inter-
viewee to bring up issues of the topic that are important
to him or her, and always end the interview by asking the
interviewee if there is anything they would like to add
regarding the topic of interest in the interview.
Tip 10
Transcribe the interviews in good time
Once the data has been collected, the process of data tran-
scription commences. Although rarely explicitly defined,
transcription can be described as the process of reproduc-
ing spoken words, such as recorded data from an inter-
view, and converting it into written form so the data can
be analyzed. The most common form of transcription in
qualitative interviews is verbatim transcription, which refers
to the word-for-word reproduction of verbal data, where
the written words are an exact replication of the audio-
recorded words (Poland 1995). Transcribing data from
qualitative interviews is very time-consuming. For novices,
initial transcription may require as much as four to eight
hours of transcription for each hour of recorded data.
Furthermore, the process yields vast amounts of material
which must be iteratively scrutinized and waded through
when analyzing the data. It is easy to think that transcrip-
tion is a somewhat straightforward conversion of the spo-
ken word into written word. It is important to consider
pauses, giggles, and other cues offered by the interviewee
as markers for important events in the interview. These
cues may need to be acknowledged in the transcription
process. During the transcription process errors can creep
in which can be the result of different factors.
Consequently, steps need to be taken to check the quality
of the transcription. Many investigators choose to tran-
scribe the qualitative interviews themselves even though
that is time-consuming and arduous, as it offers great
1004 C. MCGRATH ET AL.
benefits in terms of getting to know the data. When doing
so, we recommend researchers transcribe the interview as
soon as possible after completion. Doing so allows the
researcher to start identifying analytical structures and find
similarities and differences between different interviewees’
experiences.
Tip 11
Check the data
As part of ensuring trustworthiness in qualitative data-
driven explorations, member checking, also known as
respondent validation or participant validation, can be
used. Member checking is a method of returning an inter-
view transcript or debriefing the analytical results with par-
ticipants for agreement (Lincoln and Guba 1985; Creswell
2013). Our experience suggests that this process offers nov-
ice researcher a good opportunity to check the quality of
the data. As such, member checking may act as a sounding
board and a way of checking that one has understood the
reported responses of the respondents, especially when it
comes to picking up subtleties such as irony, emotions,
silences, or other gestures (Birt et al. 2016; McGrath et al.
2016). However, some researchers recommend caution with
reference to member checking, as there may be some
potential drawbacks such as conflicting views on interpret-
ation (Angen 2000; Morse et al. 2002; Varpio et al. 2017).
Tip 12
Initiate analysis early
One of the main difficulties with qualitative research is that
it very rapidly generates a large and cumbersome amount
of data, often leading to hundreds of pages of transcribed
text. Miles (1979) has depicted qualitative data as an
“attractive nuisance”; it has attractiveness due to its richness,
but effort is required to find analytical paths through that
richness. Therefore, you will need to think about the analysis
of data before conducting all the interviews. The nature of
the research question(s) and how you go about the analysis
will determine the depth, quality, and richness of the per-
formed interviews. Hence, we advise that the analysis of the
material is not left until all interview data has been tran-
scribed. Procrastination of data analysis may give the investi-
gator the impression of facing a monumental task;
meanwhile, an advantage of starting the work soon is that
early thoughts about the analysis allow the investigator to
become more aware of emerging categories and themes.
Summary
The qualitative research interview is a powerful data-collec-
tion tool which affords researchers in medical education
opportunities to explore unknown areas of education and
practice within medicine. This paper articulates 12 tips for
consideration when conducting qualitative research inter-
views, and outlines the qualitative research interview in
general terms. We acknowledge that certain methodologies
might demand alternative procedures than those described
above. Although the 12 steps above are ordered sequen-
tially, the qualitative interview, as a rigorous data collection
tool, requires an iterative and reflective working process in
order to best serve its purpose.
